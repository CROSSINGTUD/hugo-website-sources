CogniCrypt comprises two features to assist in the usage of cryptographic APIs. First, it may generate code wrappers around cryptographic APIs that implement programming tasks involving cryptography. Currently, CogniCrypt supports code generation for six such tasks. CogniCrypt also employs a suite of static code analyses constantly running the background and checking for misuses of cryptographic APIs. Thanks to its tight integration with Eclipse, developers are being alerted of misuses by means of regular Eclipse error markers. For more details on how to use both features, please refer to their corresponding tutorial pages:
