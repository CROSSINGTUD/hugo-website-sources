We are happy to announce the publication of Stefan Krüger's Ph.D. Thesis! The thesis gives a comprehensive introduction into CogniCrypt and the research we have been conducting over the past few years in the context of the tool.
In the thesis, Krüger motivates the work on CogniCrypt and discusses the approach, comprising of CrySL, CogniCrypt<sub>SAST</sub>, and CogniCrypt<sub>GEN</sub>, in detail. That is not all, however. In the final chapters of the thesis, Krüger also outlines several ideas for further CrySL-based tool support that should help developers use cryptographic APIs and that are already in the works.

If you have followed all research related to CogniCrypt so far, we highly recommend chapter four for an up-to-date discussion of related work, chapter six for an empirical evaluation of CogniCrypt, and chapter nine for the above-mentioned design sketches for alternate forms of tool support on top of CrySL.

If you are interested now, please check out the thesis at the [university library of Paderborn University where it was published](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/hs/document/preview/3500836).
