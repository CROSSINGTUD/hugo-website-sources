The easiest way to install CogniCrypt is through its [update site](http://download.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/). The update site currently contains the Nightly Build built on [Shippable CI](https://app.shippable.com/github/CROSSINGTUD/CogniCrypt/runs?branchName=master). 

You may also compile CogniCrypt yourself by checking its source code out from [Github](https://github.com/eclipse-cognicrypt/CogniCrypt).
